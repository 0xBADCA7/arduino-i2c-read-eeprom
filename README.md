Original work
------------

This project is based on the original work by: [andre-richter/arduino-spi-read-eeprom](https://github.com/andre-richter/arduino-spi-read-eeprom)



Introduction
------------

While I was searching for a way to dump an entire I2C EEPROM to save it as a binary file on the PC, I stumbled on the original work, mentioned above, for SPI EEPROMs.

As it uses a small program written in C, I decided to use this as a base to develop for I2C devices.



How to
------------
The simple configuration to read an I2C EEPROM is:

1. Connect the EEPROM to your Arduino's like [this](http://kamilslab.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/eeprom.jpg) or [this](http://fritzing.org/media/fritzing-repo/projects/r/readwrite-serial-eeprom-via-i2c/images/arduino-eeprom_bb.png)
    * Be sure about the A2 pin some EEPROMs must be hard wired to Vcc (e.g. 24FC1025)
2. Connect the Arduino to your PC via the USB __programming port__ and upload the sketch.
3. Compile the C program with a simple `make`
4. Run the program and supply the __MINIMAL__ arguments:
    * The tty device name of your Arduino e.g. `-t /dev/ttyACM0`
    * The number of bytes you want to read from the EEPROM: `-n 8`

The read bytes will be stored in a file called __eeprom.bin__



New features
------------

On the Arduino sketch:
- Is the same simple sketch in which the SPI interface was switched for the I2C interface (Wire library).
	- Some tutorials on using the Wire library, such as the [Wire library](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_libs_Wire.html) and also other works by [breadboardtronics/EEPROM and arduino](https://breadboardtronics.wordpress.com/2013/08/27/at24c32-eeprom-and-arduino).
	- TambÃ©m existem tutorias em PT, [exemplo](http://lusorobotica.com/index.php/topic,33.0.html) =) 
- The number of bytes passed for input was increased from 4 to 6, allowing to read up to 2Mbits

On the C program there are new features such as:
- It can save the output to a given file name (the user gives the name it wants)
- While reading the memory it's content may not be printed to the terminal (since it was annoying printing the whole memory therefore fill in the terminal)
- It can read from input n Kbytes with the program converting Kbytes to bytes, e.g. input 50k => 51200 bytes
- The overall program was enhanced, by preventing some errors in the user's input
- ~~Still work's with SPI EEPROMs~~



Compatibility
----------------------
I have tested the program with an Arduino UNO on Debian@3.16.0-4-amd64, but it should work with every POSIX compatible OS.


### TTY device names
- In Mac should be the same as the original `/dev/cu.usbmodem14931` (BUT not tested by me)
- In Linux is `/dev/ttyACM*`, where * should be 0. (you need to be root, or be in [group-mode](http://playground.arduino.cc/Linux/All#Permission))


### Compatible EEPROMs
I've tested with following devices:
 - GT24C64
 - AT24C32
 - 24FC1025 ~~(only 64Kbytes readed [more info above](#todo))~~ FIXING
 - Other's I2C EEPROMs compatible with the read protocol **(or feel free to change yourself)** ~~as long as it can ONLY READ 64Kbytes ([more info above](#todo))~~FIXING



Examples
------------
To read 1Kbytes and save it under the name test.bin and printing it's content:
 - `./i2c_read_eeprom -t /dev/ttyACM0 -n 1k -o test.bin`

To read 64Kbytes and save it under the name large.bin without printing it's content:
 - `./i2c_read_eeprom -t /dev/ttyACM0 -n 64k -o large.bin -p n`

To read 10Kbytes as text(ascii) and save it under the name readme.txt without printing it's content:
 - `./i2c_read_eeprom -t /dev/ttyACM0 -n 10k -o large.txt -f a -p n`

Add new examples


TODO
------------
- **Read more than 64Kbytes:**

~~To read more than 64Kbytes a special bit must be set. Since the protocol only sends 16bits (8bits as MSB and 8bits as LSB) for selecting the address, therefore can only read from address 0000h to FFFFh (64Kbytes).~~ FIXING

**To make the change, with so many different options depending on the device, it's better to change according to their need on the Arduino side.**

- Read from a start address to a end address

- Read smaller memory EEPROMs, some only uses 8 bits to 10 bits addressing (sending the device address+MSB and then LSB)

- ~~Some type of handshake to say that the Arduino is ready to start receiving the input, confirm it and then send the data. Something  like two-way handshake~~ Not really needed!?
