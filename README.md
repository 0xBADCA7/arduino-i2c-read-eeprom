Original work
------------

This project is based on the original work by: [andre-richter/arduino-spi-read-eeprom](https://github.com/andre-richter/arduino-spi-read-eeprom)



Introduction
------------

While I was searching for a way to dump an entire I2C EEPROM and save it as a binary file on the PC, I stumbled on the original work, mentioned above, for SPI EEPROMs.

As it uses a small program written in C, I decided to use it as a base for my work with I2C devices.



How to
------------
The simple configuration to read an I2C EEPROM is:

1. Connect the EEPROM to your Arduino's like [this](http://kamilslab.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/eeprom.jpg) or [this](http://fritzing.org/media/fritzing-repo/projects/r/readwrite-serial-eeprom-via-i2c/images/arduino-eeprom_bb.png)
    * Be sure about the A2 pin some EEPROMs must be hard wired to Vcc (e.g. 24FC1025)
2. Connect the Arduino to your PC via the USB __programming port__ and upload the sketch.
3. Compile the C program with a simple `make`
4. Run the program and supply the __MINIMAL__ arguments:
    * The tty device name of your Arduino e.g. `-t /dev/ttyACM0`
    * The number of bytes you want to read from the EEPROM: `-n 8`

The read bytes will be stored in a file called __eeprom.bin__



New features
------------

On the Arduino sketch:
- Is the same simple sketch in which the SPI interface was switched for the I2C interface (Wire library).
	- Some tutorials on using the Wire library, such as the [Wire library](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_libs_Wire.html) and also other works by [breadboardtronics/EEPROM and arduino](https://breadboardtronics.wordpress.com/2013/08/27/at24c32-eeprom-and-arduino).
	- TambÃ©m existem tutorias em PT, [exemplo](http://lusorobotica.com/index.php/topic,33.0.html) =) 
- The number of bytes passed for input was increased from 4 to 6, allowing to read up to 2Mbits

On the C program there are new features such as:
- It can save the output to a given file name (the user gives the name it wants)
- While reading the memory it's content may not be printed to the terminal (since it was annoying printing the whole memory therefore fill in the terminal)
- It can read from input n Kbytes with the program converting Kbytes to bytes, e.g. input 50k => 51200 bytes
- The type of addressing of the device can be specified with `-d` or `--dev-type` allowing to read more than 64Kbytes
- The overall program was enhanced, by preventing some errors in the user's input
- ~~Still work's with SPI EEPROMs~~



Devices address type
----------------------
Since there are multiple ways to read the whole content of EEPROM bigger than 64Kbytes or 512Kbit, a special command must be set.

### EEPROM type 1
Must set flag `-d 1` or `--dev-type=1`
Some examples are: 24XX1026, M24M01, CAT24M01, AT24CM01, ...
![type_1](https://ch3302files.storage.live.com/y3mxZhsnuO_9DcPUrTW97842UpC7beExyoSk3QyEiGdFp9on653JUQhX0QoWSAIo19gzfJeNC1Edyqk5dGZJx2DHy5K0nxpYT4s0PxcIIIK5smDBg-nZVA6gDzKD65T4x18ZSLVVDvAN-CdaRsIX0jMaEfk7MJNn6LHItQ4uzhEiTU/EEPROM1.png?psid=1&width=412&height=212 "EEPROM type 1")


### EEPROM type 2
Must set flag `-d 2` or `--dev-type=2`
Some examples are: 24XX1025 ...
![type_1](https://ch3302files.storage.live.com/y3mgOuztKNg2NeLvU86fG5qpaJqoo2f_xQ480PDv6Es6-Dxom6_HsFbfwnRAnFu59JinNi6fsCEnvU76W7uzpGoU-EIvgO3ZI1iJTkZpKbnjFe3C3E2GqODWwr1EwRV4FWYdQ_NHIfdFpaMjg7frnRqjgDQserS-ABrPoR0S7aomPM/EEPROM2.png?psid=1&width=412&height=212 "EEPROM type 2")


### EEPROM type 3
Must set flag `-d 3` or `--dev-type=3`
Some examples are: AT24CM02, M24M02, ...
![type_1](https://ch3302files.storage.live.com/y3m9FKJ-_urTKHPavZ8iY2AVayBbwfM4O2oof9KPto8IpfNu6LmP03lnkbRsRHO2Z8-nS2jUcp2eBMn4_hC5lA3iBWWTCadRsXLMT4Uic7PaKfO9XkmmeXZ6i5mOLy9waJusXbNrCAPHRmXlMJQhoOJjti_RkNuMWOScSgtFpIt99g/EEPROM3.png?psid=1&width=412&height=212 "EEPROM type 3")



Compatibility
----------------------
I have tested the program with an Arduino UNO on Debian@3.16.0-4-amd64, but it should work with every POSIX compatible OS.


### TTY device names
- In Mac should be the same as the original `/dev/cu.usbmodem14931` (BUT not tested by me)
- In Linux is `/dev/ttyACM*`, where * should be 0. (you need to be root, or be in [group-mode](http://playground.arduino.cc/Linux/All#Permission))


### Compatible EEPROMs
I've tested with the following devices:
 - GT24C64
 - AT24C32
 - 24FC1025
 - Other's I2C EEPROMs compatible with the read protocol (or feel free to do the necessary changes)



Example
------------


### Setup
```
$ git clone git@github.com:DMRodrigues/arduino-i2c-read-eeprom.git
$ cd arduino-i2c-read-eeprom
$ make
```


### Reading EEPROMs
To read 1024bits and save it under the name test.bin and printing it's content:
 - `./i2c_read_eeprom -t /dev/ttyACM0 -n 128`

To read 64Kbytes and save it under the name large.bin without printing it's content:
 - `./i2c_read_eeprom -t /dev/ttyACM0 -n 64k -o large.bin -p n`

To read 10Kbytes as text(ascii) and save it under the name readme.txt without printing it's content:
 - `./i2c_read_eeprom -t /dev/ttyACM0 -n 10k -o large.txt -f a -p n`

To read 1024Kbits from an 25XX1025 and save it without printing it's content:
 - `./i2c_read_eeprom -t /dev/ttyACM0 -n 128k -p n -d 2`

To read 1024Kbits from an 25XX1026 and save it without printing it's content:
 - `./i2c_read_eeprom -t /dev/ttyACM0 -n 128k -p n -d 1`

Afterwards, you can edit the data with your favourite hex editor.



TODO
------------
- Improve C program regarding interrupt signal and clean exit function in case of errors

- Read from a start address to a end address

- Read smaller memory EEPROMs, some only uses 8 bits to 10 bits addressing (sending the device address+MSB and then LSB)
